# Knowledge Graph Explorer - Project Rules

## Theme & Styling
- **Primary Theme Color: Green** - Always use green as the primary theme color for this project
- When creating or modifying UI components, buttons, links, accents, or any visual elements, use green color schemes
- Preferred green shades: Use modern green variants (e.g., #28a745, #20c997, #198754, or similar Bootstrap green variants)
- For texts use black and white depeding on the contrast with adjacent/background elements
- Maintain consistency with green theming across all components and pages


## Technology Stack
- React 19.2.3 with functional components and hooks
- React Bootstrap for UI components
- SCSS for styling (use .scss files, not .css)
- React Router DOM for routing

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- Follow React best practices and modern patterns
- Use Bootstrap components from react-bootstrap library
- Write SCSS in a modular way and use BEM style guides (component-specific SCSS files)
- Maintain consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, kebab-case for CSS classes)

## Project Structure
- Components should be placed in appropriate directories under `src/`
- Pages go in `src/pages/`
- Services/API calls go in `src/services/`
- Styles go in component-specific SCSS files or `src/styles/`

## General Instructions
- Always maintain the green theme when suggesting or implementing UI changes
- When adding new features, ensure they align with the green color scheme
- Keep the code clean, readable, and well-commented
- Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
- add jsdocs to functions to make them readable
