FY25 was a year of mixed trends for the
Indian Commercial Vehicle industry,
shaped by macroeconomic caution and
evolving market dynamics. The industry
recorded a marginal decline of ~1%,
primarily due to pressures in the HCV
and SCV segments, especially in Q2.
While cautious sentiment ahead of
state and general elections led to a
moderation in demand, segments like
buses remained resilient — driven by
public transport investments and the
shift to electric mobility. Encouragingly,
electric CVs gained traction,
especially in buses and last-mile
applications, supported by improving
TCO economics. Across the board,
infrastructure investments, cleaner fuel
adoption, and digitalisation continued
to shape fleet and OEM strategies.

Sustaining momentum,
driving impact:
In a year of varying demand, Tata
Motors Commercial Vehicles
built further on the foundation
of financial fitness laid in FY24 to
deliver an improved performance
with disciplined cost management,
improved realisation, and the growing
contribution of our Parts, Service
and other Downstream businesses.
Despite marginal declines in sales
volumes, our EBIT reached an all-time
high of I6,794 crore — representing
a 4.9% growth over FY24. The business
outperformed the industry, gaining
share and improving realisation in
Trucks and Buses.
With the restructuring into eight
focused business verticals now fully
embedded, our transformation into
a future-ready, customer-centric
organisation is enhancing our agility,
strengthening accountability, and
aligning us more closely with both our
strategic priorities and the evolving
needs of our customers.

Building an end-to-end ecosystem:
A core part of our long-term strategy is
building a vibrant, digitally connected
ecosystem that includes suppliers,
channel partners, mechanics,
financiers, fleet owners, logistics
providers, and — importantly —
drivers. By leveraging our extensive
physical network and digital platforms
such as Fleet Edge, we deliver
integrated, tech-enabled solutions to
all ecosystem players.
The adoption of smart telematics
across ~8,00,000 vehicles is
enabling data-driven decisions that
improve uptime, reduce operating
costs, and enhance driver safety.
Our Customer Success Centres (CSCs)
are helping fleet operators maximise
performance and minimise downtime.
Our comprehensive engagement also
extends to mechanics and Logistic
Service Providers through initiatives
like Fleet Edge and Fleet Verse,
ensuring a cohesive and future-ready
CV ecosystem.
