Sales
To serve its consumers, your Company has an omni-channel approach, which implies that the brands are available
at locations and channels that are most convenient for consumers.

RUrban
Your Company strengthened
its route-to-market through a
comprehensive RUrban strategy
focused on five key pillars:
Infrastructure, Product Portfolio,
Technology, Visibility and
Consumer Connect. Your Company
scaled its ‘Total reach’, primarily
led by its expansion in RUrban
areas. With an increase of 7.5%
during the period under review,
your Company’s expansion in
total reach across all geographies
was the highest amongst peers
in the industry. This was achieved
through your Company's concerted
efforts to strengthen its distribution
touchpoints, which grew from
20,783 to 28,240 during the
period under review

These efforts together helped
your Company to be present in
approximately 209,050 villages.
Your Company also continued to
increase RUrban smart stores to
influence shoppers at the point of
sale and engage with consumers
through haat activities, in
weekly village markets

Your Company also continued to
engage with women from rural
areas under Project Swabhimaan
to foster entrepreneurial skills by
upskilling and training them. This
initiative added more than 250
women entrepreneurs in the period
under review taking the cumulative
number to more than 2,100.
Technology interventions
remained the bedrock of business
acceleration in RUrban, and
initiatives such as the industry-first
RD DMS (Re-Distributor 'Distributor
Management Solution') solution
helped automate your Company’s
sub-distributors in RUrban markets

E-commerce 
The rapid growth of quick
commerce in India has been
changing consumer landscape
and the increasing demand for

of smartphones and internet
connectivity, consumers are
increasingly seeking faster and
more efficient ways to shop. Quick
commerce, with its focus on rapid
delivery, has emerged as a solution
to meet these evolving needs.
Your Company’s e-commerce
business experienced accelerated
growth, primarily driven by Quick
Commerce. E-commerce business
contributed 8.6% to sales in
the period under review. Quick
commerce growth continued to
be aided by new user acquisition
initiatives through targeted digital
communication across various
touchpoints. This contributed
approximately 45% of the
e-commerce business.
Campaigns for new product
launches, including NESCAFÉ
Ready-to-Drink cold coffee range
were run on Quick Commerce
platforms which were extremely
well-received by the consumers,
thus giving the brands a fillip.
